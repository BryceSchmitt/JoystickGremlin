<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The main goal of Joystick Gremlin is to allow you to perform various
actions in response to pressing keys on the keyboard or using a joystick.</p>

<p>There are four main concepts that Joystick Gremlin uses to organize and
describe configurations:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Input, keyboard keys, joystick axis, buttons and hats all are inputs</li>
    <li>Action, a single action executed when an input is used</li>
    <li>Mode, a collection of actions can be grouped together into a mode</li>
    <li>Profile, the file containing all modes and their associated actions</li>
</ol>

<h2>Creating a New Profile</h2>

<p>As such creating a new profile involves the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a new empty profile</li>
    <li>Create at least one mode</li>
    <li>Add actions to different inputs</li>
    <li>Save the profile</li>
    <li>Run the profile</li>
</ol>

<h3>1. Create a new empty profile</h3>

<p>Before you can start adding actions to various inputs you need to create a
new mode. This is achieved via <i>Tools > Manage Modes</i>. This opens a new
window, clicking on the <b>Add Mode</b> button allows you to add a new
mode.</p>

<h3>3. Add actions to different inputs</h3>

<p>Once you have added a new mode you can assign actions to the various inputs
by clicking on the appropriate button in the UI or pressing the desired button,
moving the desired axis on the joystick. Once the input for which you want to
add an action is selected you can select the type of action to add from the
dropdown list and then press the <b>Add</b> button. Depending on what type of
action was added different settings can be changed.</p>

<h3>4. Save the profile</h3>
