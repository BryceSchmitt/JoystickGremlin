<h4>The game does not see Joystick Gremlin inputs, only the original joystick ones.</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    This wil happen quite often as Joystick Gremlin cannot hide the physical
    devices inputs. To circumvent this issue the <em>Input Repeater</em> tool
    was implemented. You can activate it via <em>Tools > Input Repeater</em>.
    Once activated go into the game's input remaping screen, use the input you
    want to map by either pressing or moving it. Then, activate the remapping
    dialog of the game and it should recognize the virtual joystick's input.
    The input repeater will repeat your input for a duration of five seconds.

<h4>How to verify that Joystick Gremlin produces the desired output?</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    The simplest way which doesn't require any additional tools is to use the
    Windows game controller program, which can be launched by running
    <em>joy.cpl</em>. To see the output simply open the dialog for the desired
    vJoy device. One drawback of this tool is that it requires focus to show
    anything which can be a bit cumbersome at times. Some alternative programs
    which can show information about various joystick devices are:

<h4>Macros don't work in-game</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    The most likely cause for this is that the game was launched with
    administrator privileges while Joystick Gremlin was launched with normal
    user privileges. As the macro system injects key presses into the Windows
    event system Joystick Gremlin has to have the same or higher privilege
    level as the receiving application. As such if the game is run as
    administrator then Joystick Gremlin needs to be run as administrator as
    well.
