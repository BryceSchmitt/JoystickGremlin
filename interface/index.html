        <li>Overview of all the inputs available for a given device. The
            small icons on the far right of each input indicate the type
            of actions associated with the input. The icons and their
            meaning are summarised in the table below.</li>
        <li>The right hand portion of the UI shows the list of actions
            associated with the currently selected input. This panel
            allows the customisation of existing actions and the
            addition of new ones.</li>
        <li>The mode section allows changing the mode currently being

        <li>The status bar shows whether or not the program is currently
            running a profile. If the program is running the currently
            active mode is shown as well if code execution is
            paused. If the input repeater is active it's status is also
            shown in the far right.</li>

<h3><a name="2_2">2.2 Conditions</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    Each action has a set of conditions, based on the input type, that
    can be used to further restrict when the action is executed. These
    constraints are explained next.
</p>

<h4 class="subsection">Button and Keyboard Key</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    Actions associated with button like inputs have three constraints:
    <dl class="dl-horizontal text-justify">
        <dt>on_press</dt>
        <dd>execute the action when the key or button is being
        pressed</dd>
        <dt>on_release</dt>
        <dd>execute the action when the key or button is being
        released</dd>
        <dt>shift key</dt>
        <dd>execute the action when the specified key or button is being
        pressed</dd>
    </dl>
    These conditions work together, so for example if a <em>shift
    key</em> is defined the <em>on_press</em> and <em>on_release</em>
    conditions still have to be met in order for the action to be executed.
</p>

<h4 class="subsection">Axis</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    Actions associated with axis inputs have a range based constraint
    which allows to treat the axis as a button when it enters and leaves
    the specified range. This works by considering a virtual button
    being pressed when the axis enters the range and releasing the
    virtual button when leaving the range.
</p>

<h4 class="subsection">Hat</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    The eight directions of POV hats can be treated a simple activation
    actions to trigger any action that typically would fire on an
    <em>on_press</em> event. As such all actions available to buttons
    with the exception of remapping are available using these
    conditions.
</p>


<h3><a name="2_3">2.3 Actions</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    As described in <a href="/JoystickGremlin/overview/#1_2">Section 1.2</a>,
    each input, such as axis, button, hat, or keyboard key, can have multiple
    actions associated with it. However, not all inputs have access to the same
    types of actions as they are not applicable to them. In the following all
    available actions are described.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Each action has an activation condition associated with it, see <a
    href="#2_2">Section 2.2</a>, which can be used for fine grained
    control over them. Additionally, each input can also be configured to
    be always executed by checking the <em>Always Execute</em> box, see
    item 2 in the above image. Enabling this option results in actions
    associated with that input to be performed even if execution of
    callbacks is paused. This is mainly useful for resuming when
    execution has been paused.
</p>

<h4 class="subsection">Remapping</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/action_remap_axis.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Axis remapping dialogue</em>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/action_remap_button.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Button remapping dialogue</em>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/action_remap_hat.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Hat remapping dialogue</em>
    </div>
</div>
</br>

<p class="text-justify">
    The remapping actions enable the user to propagate inputs from a
    physical joystick input to an equivalent vJoy input, i.e. axis to
    axis, button to button, and hat to hat.  This allows the merging of
    multiple physical devices into a single device.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    In the case of axis remapping the condition can be used to press a
    vJoy button while the axis in a certain range and release it once
    the range is left. This could for example be used to engage
    afterburners when a throttle is set to greater then 95%.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning text-justify">
    In most cases button remap actions should always trigger, i.e. on
    button press and release, as otherwise the forwarding to vJoy is
    incomplete.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">Response Curve</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/action_response_curve.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Response curve action dialogue which allows the customisation
            of the joystick response as well as dead zones.</em>
    </div>
</div>
</br>

<p class="text-justify">
    The response curve dialogue allows the customisation of
    the response produced by the joystick using the curve editor. The
    shape of the curve is controlled using a set of control points.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    A new control point is added by a double left click in an empty area
    of the curve editor. Removing an existing control point is achieved
    by selecting the desired point and pressing the <kbd>Del</kbd> key
    on the keyboard. A single left click on a control point will mark
    the point as active. An active point can be dragged in the window to
    modify its position. Alternatively, the text fields below the curve
    editor allow for precise numerical control of the position.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Finally, the dead zones for the axis can be defined using the sliders
    and input fields at the bottom of the dialogue. The fields and
    sliders control the full deflection dead zone (1st and 4th field
    from the left) as well as the centre deflection dead zones (2nd and
    3rd field).
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Currently there are two types of response curve types available which
    are selected from the drop down menu at the top of the widget:
    <dl class="dl-horizontal text-justify">
        <dt>Cubic Spline</dt>
        <dd>A simple spline with only control points dictating locations
            the curve has to pass through. No control over the shape is
            provided.</dd>
        <dt>Cubic B&eacute;zier Spline</dt>
        <dd>A more complex spline with control points and "handles" that
            can modify the shape of the overall curve. Importantly this
            allows to control how the curve approaches the end points of
            the curve.</dd>
    </dl>
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning text-justify">
    A response curve mapping action always needs to be paired with a
    remap action, as otherwise the transformation will not have any
    effect.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning text-justify">
    In order for response curves to work properly the game has to be configured
    to use a linear 1:1 curve, as otherwise the two curve settings will
    interfere with each other producing undesirable results. This also applies
    when using vJoy response curves, if they are not linear the output produced
    by this action will be further modified.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">Macro</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/action_macro.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Macro action dialogue allowing the recording of key press
            sequences.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    The macro dialogue allows the creation of keyboard
    macros. The macro can contain any combination of key presses and
    releases, as well as pauses between individual actions.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Adding new keystrokes to a macro is done by pressing the
    <em>Record</em> button, after which all keystrokes will be recorded
    sequentially. To stop the recording simply press the <em>Record</em>
    button again. A pause can be added by pressing the <em>Add
    Pause</em> button, which will insert a pause after the currently
    selected entry. The length of the pause can be modified by double
    clicking the entry. Selecting an entry allows it to be moved up and down
    using the <em>Up</em> and <em>Down</em> buttons.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning text-justify">
    Each macro is executed independently, which means that multiple long
    running macros can have their key presses interfere with each other.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">Pause, Resume &amp; Toggle</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/action_pause.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Pause dialogue which allows to temporarily stop the execution of
            callbacks.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/action_resume.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Resume dialogue which allows Joystick Gremlin to execute
            callbacks again after enabling the pause state.</em>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/action_toggle_pause_resume.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>Toggle between pause and resume dialogue, which toggles
            between the two states.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    The pause, resume, and toggle actions control whether or not
    Joystick Gremlin executes callbacks when inputs are used. When the
    application is paused only inputs that were configured to <em>always
    execute</em> will be executed.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning text-justify">
    In order for the <em>resume</em> and <em>toggle</em> actions to be
    useful they have to be defined as <em>always execute</em>, as
    otherwise it will be impossible to resume from the paused state.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">Change Mode</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/action_switch_mode.jpg">

            to switch to when the action is triggered.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    This action will change the currently active mode of Joystick
    Gremlin to the one selected from the drop down list.

<h4 class="subsection">Switch to Previous Mode</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">

            mode.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    This action changes the current mode to the previously active one.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">Cycle Modes</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">

        <em>The dialogue of the cycle modes action allows adding various
            action which will be cycled through in order on each
            subsequent activation.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    This action allows the configuration of a list of modes
    that are cycled through consecutively with each activation. In case
    that the currently active mode is not part of the list the first
    mode in the list will be activated.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    New modes can be added by selecting the desired mode in the drop
    down list and pressing the <em>Add</em> button. The currently
    selected mode can be deleted by pressing the <em>Delete</em> button
    and moved up or down with the <em>Up</em> and <em>Down</em> button
    respectively.

<h3><a name="2_4">2.4 Tools</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    In the following section the various tools provided by Joystick
    Gremlin are described. They can be accessed via the <em>Tools</em>
    and <em>Actions</em> menus.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">Mode Manager</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/mode_manager.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>The mode manager allows the creation, deletion, and renaming
            of modes as well as defining their relationships.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    The mode manager, accessed via <em>Tools > Manage Modes</em>, allows users
    to create new modes, delete existing ones and define which mode inherits
    configurations from others. Pressing "Add Mode" adds a new mode, pressing
    the button to the right of each mode with the <strong>x</strong> on it
    deletes it, and the button with a pen icon allows renaming a mode. Finally,
    using the drop down menu each mode can be configured to inherit from one
    other mode by selecting its name or not inheriting from any mode by
    selecting the "None" entry.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">User Module Manager</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/user_module_manager.jpg">

        <em>The user module manager dialogue lists the custom modules Joystick
            Gremlin should load.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    While the UI allows to perform common tasks there will be functionality
    that is not present. However, by using custom modules, described in <a
    href="/JoystickGremlin/custom_modules">Section 3</a>, the limitations of
    the UI can easily be overcome.  The module configuration dialogue is
    accessed via <em>Tools > Manage Custom Modules</em>. The modules listed
    there will be loaded in conjunction with the UI based configuration,
    allowing the use of the UI for common tasks and implementing specialised
    functionality in a custom module.  Modules are added via the <em>Add</em>
    button and likewise removed by selecting the desired module and pressing the
    <em>Delete</em> button.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    In order for Joystick Gremlin to successfully load the additional
    modules they have to be placed in the same folder as the profile
    file itself.

<h4 class="subsection">Merge Axis</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/merge_axis.jpg">

            should be combined into a single virtual one.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    This dialog allows the selection of any arbitrary two physical axis and the
    virtual axis their combined output should be assigned to.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">Input Repeater</h4>

<p class="text-justify">
    When enabling the <em>Input Repeater</em> option, while Joystick
    Gremlin is active, via <em>Tools > Input Repeater</em>, Joystick
    Gremlin will repeat the last remapped input after a short wait
    period. This allows button presses and axes movements to be mapped
    in-game when the game detects the physical device's inputs instead
    of the virtual ones. The status bar provides information about the
    current action of the input repeater when activated.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">Device Information</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/device_information.jpg">

    <div class="col-md-5">
        <em>The device information dialogue provides an overview of the
            inputs and identification of the various joystick devices
            present in the system.</em>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    Information about connected devices can be accessed via <em>Tools >
    Device Information</em>. This window provides an overview of the
    devices known to Joystick Gremlin, listing the name as well as some
    basic information about each device. The <em>System ID</em>
    represents the order in which the devices are seen by the operating
    system, while the <em>Hardware ID</em> is an identifier that is
    unique to each device.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning text-justify">
    The currently used hardware id is not device, but product specific.
    As such it can not distinguish between two identical joysticks. To
    distinguish those the system id is used. When there are no duplicate
    devices present the system id is ignored.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">Calibration</h4>

<div class="row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/calibration.jpg">

</div>
</br>

<p class="text-justify">
    The axes calibration screen, accessed via <em>Tools >
    Calibration</em>, allows the calibration of connected devices
    independent of Windows. The window shows the current, minimum,
    centre, and maximum value for each analogue axis of the selected
    device. To calibrate the axes simply move them through their full
    range of motions and press the <em>Centred</em> button when all axes
    are centred. Once done press <em>Save</em> to save the calibration
    of the currently selected device to the configuration file.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">Cheatsheet Generation</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    To help remember complex setups Joystick Gremlin has the ability to
    create PDF and HTML cheatsheets of the current profile. The output lists
    for each mode the actions of the available devices together with the
    user provided description.
</p>


<h4 class="subsection">Create 1:1 Mapping</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    In order to make the initial setup quicker Joystick Gremlin can
    create a 1:1 mapping for the user. To do this select the entry from
    the <em>Actions</em> menu. This will result in each input being
    assigned the next free corresponding action, i.e. buttons are mapped
    to buttons and axes to axes.
</p>

<h4 class="subsection">Profile Creator</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    In order to enable easier sharing of configurations, even if different
    devices are used, the Profile Creator allows creating a new profile from an
    existing one. When started the tool asks for a profile to use as a template
    and then presents all the bound actions within to the user for binding to
    their particular devices.
</p>

<div class="text-justify row bottom-gap">
    <div class="col-md-5">
        The interface shows:
        <ul>
            <li>Description of the action</li>
            <li>Type of actions used</li>
            <li>What input the action is currently bound to</li>
        </ul>
        Clicking on the button allows the user to press / move the input they wish
        to associate with the particular action. Once this is done the button will
        reflect this binding. When all desired actions are bound the configuration
        can be saved as a new profile by clicking on the save button.
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-7">
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/JoystickGremlin/images/create_profile.png">

</div>

<p class="alert alert-warning text-justify">
    This tool is only capable of binding actions defined via the UI and if
    custom modules are used in a profile those will not be automatically
    adapted to the new devices used.

<h4 class="subsection">Log viewer</h4>
<div class="row bottom-gap">

        <dd>Instead of quiting the application when it is closed, Joystick
            Gremlin is simply minimized to the system tray.</dd>
        <dt>Start Joystick Gremlin minimized</dt>
        <dd>Launches Joystick Gremlin minimized to the system tray instead of
            opening the main window.</dd>
        <dt>Show message when changing mode</dt>
        <dd>Displays a windows notification when the mode is changed.</dd>
    </dl>
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    The <em>Profiles</em> tab exposes the following options:
    <dl class="text-justify">
        <dt>Automatically load profile based on current application</dt>
        <dd>This option makes Joystick Gremlin to automatically load and
            activate the profile assigned to the currently active
            application.</dd>
    </dl>
    The drop down menu and input fields allow selecting the executable and the
    profile associated with it. When an executable specified in this list is
    active the profile associated with it is automatically loaded and
    activated. Once the profile stops being the active one Joystick Gremlin is
    automatically stopped.
