<h2><a name="1">1. Overview</a></h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    Joystick Gremlin is a program that allows the configuration of joystick
    like devices, similar to what CH Control Manager and Thrustmaster's
    T.A.R.G.E.T. do for their respectively supported joysticks. However,
    Joystick Gremlin works with any device be it from different manufacturers
    or custom devices that appear as a joystick to Windows. Joystick Gremlin
    uses the virtual joysticks provided by vJoy to map physical to virtual
    inputs and apply various other transformations such as response curves to
    analogue axes. In addition to managing joysticks, Joystick Gremlin also
    provides keyboard macros, a flexible mode system, scripting using Python,
    and many other features.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    The main features are:
    <ul class="text-justify">
        <li>Works with arbitrary joystick like devices</li>
        <li>User interface for common configuration tasks</li>
        <li>Merging of multiple physical devices into a single virtual device</li>
        <li>Axis response curve and dead zone configuration</li>
        <li>Arbitrary number of modes with inheritance and customizable mode switching</li>
        <li>Keyboard macros for joystick buttons and keyboard keys</li>
        <li>Python scripting support</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Joystick Gremlin provides a graphical user interface, described in <a
    href="{{ site.baseurl }}/interface">Section 2</a>, which allows commonly
    performed tasks, such as input remapping, axis response curve setups, and
    macro recording to be performed easily. Functionality that is not accessible
    via the UI can be implemented through custom modules, explained in <a
    href="{{ site.baseurl }}/custom_modules">Section 3</a> in detail.
</p>


<h3><a name="1_1">1.1 Installation</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    Joystick Gremlin has one major dependency, vJoy which provides virtual
    joysticks which Joystick Gremlin feeds with data. Download links to the
    programs needed are listed below:

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/WhiteMagic/JoystickGremlin">Joystick Gremlin</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/">vJoy</a> (direct
            download link <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/files/Beta%202.x/2.0.5-120515/vJoy_205_050515.exe/download">2.0.5
                2015-05-12</a>)</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555">VC Redistributable  2010 (x86)</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784">VC Redistributable 2013 (x86)</a>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    It's important that the VC Redistributables are the x86 ones, even if
    you're running a x64 system, as vJoy and Python require the 32bit
    libraries.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    vJoy creates virtual joysticks which show up as a device in Windows and
    Joystick Gremlin uses these to forward inputs to them. The VC2010 package
    is required by Python but is likely already installed. The same goes for
    the VC2013 package which is required by vJoy but is most likely already
    installed on the machine.
</p>



<h4 class="subsection">vJoy Configuration</h4>

<p class="text-justify">
    In order to properly use Joystick Gremlin vJoy has to be configured first.
    This is done via the <i>Configure vJoy</i> program. This program allows
    setting the properties of all existing vJoy devices. Typically a single
    vJoy device is enough. In order to use 8-way POV hats with Joystick Gremlin
    the hats have the be configured as continuous in vJoy.  The image below
    shows what a properly configured vJoy device looks like. Once everything is
    set as desired clicking <i>Ok</i> configures the vJoy device and closes the
    program.

<h3><a name="1_2">1.2 Concepts</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    The following section introduces the terminology used by Joystick Gremlin.
</p>

We'll explain the different concepts from the inner most going outwards, as the
outer parts contain parts further in.

<h4 class="subsection">Action</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    An action is something Joystick Gremlin executes in response to the user
    activating a physical input.  Examples include running a macro, sending
    button presses to vJoy, or changing to a different mode. Each action has a
    condition attached to it which can further dictate when an action is to be
    executed. For buttons the conditions are the state, i.e.  pressed or
    released as well as an optional shift modifier which has be be pressed in
    order for the action to be run.
</p>

<h4 class="subsection">Input</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    An input is an axis, button, hat, or keyboard key on a physical device.
    Each input can have multiple actions assigned to it and these actions
    can change between the different modes.
</p>

<h4 class="subsection">Device</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    A device is a physical controller connected to the computer such as a
    joystick, pedal, or throttle. Each device has multiple inputs with their
    own associated actions.
</p>

<h4 class="subsection">Mode</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    A mode is a collection of actions associated with the inputs for each
    connected device. Each mode can inherit from one other mode, his parent.
    If a mode and its parent both define actions for the same input only the
    actions of the mode and not its parent are used. Similarly, if the mode
    defines no actions for an input but the parent does the parent's actions
    are used.  This allows having a common set of base commands that more
    specialised modes add to or change.
</p>

<h4 class="subsection">Profile</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    A profile is a folder which contains a XML configuration file together
    with any custom modules used. The profile contains the settings made via
    the user interface for each of the connected peripherals.
</p>

<h4 class="subsection">Example</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
    The following is a simple example showing how the above introduced concepts
    work together. The profile contains two modes, <em>Default</em> and
    <em>Landing</em> and two physical devices <em>Thrustmaster Warthog
    Stick</em> and <em>CH Pro Pedals</em>. Both devices have varying actions
    executed on the exemplary inputs used which change between the two modes. The
    image on the right shows the conceptual nesting of the concepts as shown in the
    explicit example.
