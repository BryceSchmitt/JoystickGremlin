</p>


<h2>buttons_to_hat.py</h2>

<h2>circular_deadzone.py</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
    This plugin allows the configuration of a circular deadzone which
    applies a radial deadzone around the center of two axes and a box
    deadzone around the edge. This results in a deadzone which looks
    something like the following:
    <div class="text-center">
        <img width="50%" class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.url }}/user_plugins_code/deadzone.png">
    </div>
    The inner white circle is the circular deadzone while the dark blue
    outer box is the max deflection deadzone. The light blue are is
    being mapped to [-1, 1].
    </br>
    In order to use response curves with this plugin the curve have to
    be applied to the vJoy axes onto which the two physical axes are
    mapped via the plygin.
