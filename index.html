<p class="text-justify">
    Joystick Gremlin is a program that allows the configuration of joystick
    like devices, similar to what CH Control Manager and Thrustmaster's
    T.A.R.G.E.T. do for their respectively supported joysticks. However,
    Joystick Gremlin works with any device be it from different manufacturers
    or custom devices that appear as a joystick to Windows. Joystick Gremlin
    uses the virtual joysticks provided by vJoy to map physical to virtual
    inputs and apply various other transformations such as response curves to
    analogue axes. In addition to managing joysticks, Joystick Gremlin also
    provides keyboard macros, a flexible mode system, scripting using Python,
    and many other features.

<p class="text-justify">
    The main features are:
    <ul class="text-justify">
        <li>Works with arbitrary joystick like devices</li>
        <li>User interface for common configuration tasks</li>
        <li>Merging of multiple physical devices into a single virtual device</li>
        <li>Axis response curve and dead zone configuration</li>
        <li>Arbitrary number of modes with inheritance and customizable mode switching</li>
        <li>Keyboard macros</li>
        <li>Python scripting support</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    There are a few other tools which provide some of the above features,
    including:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Snoothy/UCR" target="_blank">Universal Control Remapper</a> (successor to UJR)</li>
        <li><a href="http://evilc.com/2017/05/01/ujr-universal-joystick-remapper/" target="_blank">Universal Joystick Remapper</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://xedocproject.com/joystickcurves.html" target="_blank">Joystick Curves</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/" target="_blank">FreePie</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://ahkscript.org/" target="_blank">AutoHotkey</a></li>
    </ul>
    Compared to Joystick Gremlin the above tools, with the exception of UCR,
    either have limited functionality due to being intended for a more specific
    task or require more manual coding as they are a more general purpose tool.
    As such Joystick Gremlin sits somewhere in between aimed at providing a
    complete package for joystick configuration and management.
