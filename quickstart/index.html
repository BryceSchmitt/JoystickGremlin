<h2><a name="2">2. Quick Start</a></h2>

The following is intended as a simple guide that introduces the concepts
used in Joystick Gremlin by the way of examples of how common tasks are
achieved.

One can think of Gremlin as a reacting to the user's input, i.e. when
the user does something Gremlin will react in a way specified by the
user. In a sense the following summarizes the way Gremlin operates:
<blockquote class="alert-success">
<!--<div class="well">-->
When I press this button on my joystick, I want the following to happen.
<!--</div>-->
</blockquote>

This is also reflected by the design of the UI which is divided
vertically into two parts. The left hand side lists all the physical
inputs of a joystick, such as axes, buttons, and hats. The right
hand side lists the action associated with a particular physical input.
Going back to the above idea the left hand side contains the <em>When I
press this button on my joystick</em> part while the right hand side
reflects the <em>I want the following to happen</em>.

<h3>Simple 1:1 Mappings</h3>

The simplest type of mappings are remapping a physical input to a
virtual one, this is done using the <em>Remap</em> action. The other
basic action is to map a physical input to a keyboard key through the
<em>Map to Keyboard</em> action. These two actions together allow
merging of multiple physical devices into one virtual or using existing
keyboard mappings of a game directly without having to create custom key
bindings.

<h3>Dealing with Axes</h3>


<h3>Containers</h3>

Sometimes it is desirable to use a single physical input for multiple
different actions. This is achieved through what are called
<em>containers</em>. These containers hold different actions and use
them in a particular way that is defined by the container itself. The
<em>Tempo</em> container has two sets of actions. The first set is used
when the physical input is only pressed quickly. The second set is used
when the physical input is pressed for longer. Effectively this allows
two different types of actions to run from a single physical input.
Another container <em>Chain</em> is used when with each press of the
physical input a different action in a sequence should run. As an
example A -> B -> C -> A.

<h3>Modes</h3>

While in many cases a simple setup, mapping physical inputs to actions
is enough, there are always instances when a more complex setup where
physical inputs change their meaning are desired. To support this type
of configuration the concept of modes is introduced. A mode is a
completely self container set of mappings from physical inputs to
actions. Switching between those is supported via actions. As sometimes
it is desired to keep certain mappings intact across several modes, for
example flight controls in a flight simulator, modes support inheriting
action mappings which allows the user to override only those actions the
want to change while keeping others like they were in the mode they
inherited from.
