Introduction
======================================================================

This software uses vjoy to allow users to combine arbitrary joystick
like devices into a single or multiple vjoy devices. The mapping can
be a simple pass through or more complex mappings. In addition to this
mapping various other configurations can be performed. Essentially it
provides functionality that custom device configuration software
allows on a per device basis to all connected devices at once.

There are two ways to use this program.
1. Simple UI based configuration
2. Advanced Python script based configuration

The first method allows typical tasks to be performed via a graphical
user interface. While this has some limitations it is a quick an easy
way to get started. The advanced method allows custom configurations
to be written using the Python scripting language while still having
access to an API that exposes the functionality provided by the user
interface.

In addition to configuring and mapping joystick inputs to vjoy the
program also features a keyboard macro system which can trigger any
action based on a keyboard or joystick button pressed. The action can
be interacting with the vjoy devices or triggering custom keyboard
macros or even changing the currently used configuration mode.


Used Software
======================================================================
- pyinstaller [1]
- PyQT5 [2]
- PyWin32 [5]
- SDL2 [6]
- VJoy [7]
- Python 3.4 [8]
- PySDL2 [10]
- Mako [11]
- Qt5 [4]

The icons used in the application are Modern UI Icons [9].


Generating the MSI Installer
======================================================================

The job of turning the Python code in a windows executable and
packaging everything up into an installable MSI file is performed
by pyinstaller [1] and wix [3]. The steps needed to build the code
and assemble it into the installer is automated using a batch
script and can be run as:
  
  deplpy.bat

To simply generate the executable code without the MSI installer the
following command can be used:

  pyinstaller -y --clean joystick_gremlin.spec
