<h2><a name="4">4. Technical Design</a></h2>

<p class="alert alert-warning text-justify">
    This section is currently partially out of date and requires updating with
    Release 8 information.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    This section contains information related to implementation details of
    Joystick Gremlin. This is mainly intended for those that want to get a
    deeper understanding of the internals or extend Joystick Gremlin in some
    way.
</p>


<h3><a name="4_1">4.1 Qt Signal &amp; Slots for Input Event Communication</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    The inputs generated by the user are captured by the
    <code>EventListener</code> class in the <code>gremlin.event_handler</code>
    module, where they are turned into an <code>Event</code> object which
    is propagated using <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/signalsandslots.html">
    Qt's signal / slot</a> mechanism. Joystick events are retrieved using
    SDL2 while keyboard events are capture by hooking directly into the
    Windows event queue.
</p>


<h3><a name="4_2">4.2 Threaded Macro System</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    Each macro consists of a sequence of actions which are executed one after
    the other. Each macro is run in a separate thread in order to prevent
    Joystick Gremlin to become unresponsive. This allows multiple macros to run
    at the same time and over long periods of time. However, a side effect of
    this is that if multiple long running macros are active at the same time
    they can interfere with each other.
</p>


<h3><a name="4_3">4.3 Action Plugin System for UI Widgets</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    Every action exposed in the UI consists of two classes derived from
    <code>AbstractAction</code> and <code>AbstractActionWidget</code>. A class
    derived from <code>AbstractAction</code> is responsible for the data of the
    action including parsing from XML, generating XML, and generating Python
    code. The <code>AbstractActionWidget</code> on the other hand is
    responsible for the presentation of the data, updating the state of the
    data to the <code>AbstractAction</code>, and initialising the UI based on
    <code>AbstractAction</code> data.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Each <code>AbstractAction</code> class has to provide the following
    information in the form of class variables:
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt><code>icon</code></dt>
        <dd>the path to the image to use as indicator icon in the input item
            selection list</dd>
        <dt><code>name</code></dt>
        <dd>the name to use when displaying this action</dd>
        <dt><code>widget</code></dt>
        <dd>the widget class used by the UI to represent this action</dd>
        <dt><code>input_types</code></dt>
        <dd>the list of <code>UIInputType</code> types this action is
            applicable to</dd>
    </dl>
    In addition to these variables each implementation has to define the
    following methods:
    <ul>
        <li><code>_parse_xml(self, node)</code>, which parses the provided XML
            node into internal storage</li>
        <li><code>_generate_xml(self)</code>, which returns a XML node
            representing the object's content</li>
        <li><code>_generate_code(self)</code>, which returns a dictionary
            containing the Python code for this action</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    The widget which is used to display and configure the action has to be
    derived from the <code>AbstractActionWidget</code> class. Each derived
    class needs to provide implementations of the following methods:
    <ul class="text-justify">
        <li><code>_setup_ui(self)</code>, which creates all the UI elements and
            other structures necessary for the proper working of the
            widget</li>
        <li><code>to_profile(self)</code>, which updates the contents of the
            derived <code>AbstractItem</code> associated with this widget</li>
        <li><code>initialize_from_profile(self, action_data)</code>, which
            initialises the data displayed by the widget with the data of
            the provided profile action</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Any newly created action needs to have its corresponding
    <code>AbstractItem</code> class registered in the <code>action_lookup</code> dictionary
    in the <code>gremlin.profile</code> module.
</p>


<h3><a name="4_4">4.4 XML Storage</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">
    Each profile is stored in a single XML file. The contents of the XML file
    are used to populate the UI as well as generate Python code representing
    the profile. The file is parsed by the <code>Profile</code> class in the
    <code>gremlin.profile</code> module.
</p>
